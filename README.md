# Burger Time 
Built using raylib cpp setup in VSCode with extensions. 
cmake and make to run and execute game. 

# Development Notes
Game file(s) in src. 
    _Everything else is raylib which I have yet to fully understand_ 
.cpp in src, make, run output executable, play game. <- general idea. 

# Resources
raylib documentation, wiki, youtube.
